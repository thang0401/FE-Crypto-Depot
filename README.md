pains and solutions
----------------------
The cryptocurrency market is neither too young nor too old, so there are still many unresolved issues within the industry.

the market pains:
What happens if you have an unexpected accident and you haven't shared your private key or seed phrase with anyone? Your crypto assets will remain in your wallet forever, and your family will not be able to access them.
There is a lot of information on the internet about people forgetting their private keys or passwords, resulting in them losing all their funds.
If your public key is exposed, your wallet balance will always be monitored. Users will lose their privacy and have their transactions tracked.
And these are the reasons our project, Crypto Bank, was created. We provide solutions to these problems:

our solutions:
Our application allows users to create a will and insurance to prepare for unexpected incidents through a savings account while ensuring that the balance of your savings account remains private.
The wallet can revoke access to your wallet. We will keep your assets safe and retrievable.
We provide a multi-factor authentication transfer platform that enhances security compared to traditional Web3 wallet transactions.
